    The prompt and principal that I have chosen for Interactive Media Assignment 3 was Playful and Feedback. 
    For playful I decided to make my interactive website contain circles that randomly move around the screen.
    In order to make it a "playful" aspect, I originally planned to have each circle create a different 
    interaction, which leads me to my principal "feedback." However, after some thought I changed my plan.
    Rather than having the circles cause different interactions, I wanted them to at least work together. So to
    solve this I changed the circles to each having their own musical sound when interacted with. I was then 
    advised by my Interactive Media teacher Patrick that it might be better to have the interaction as a "hover" 
    rather than a "mouse click" in order for the users to play the sounds more smoothly. He also showed me a video
    on youtube called "Beatsurfing - The Organic Multitouch MIDI Controller Builder by Herrmutt Lobby." The video 
    showcases an app on the ipad called "Beatsurfing." The app allows users to create different beats by interacting
    with different shapes that the users are able to place themselves. This video was also very inspirational as 
    the playful prompt and feedback principal ideas were similar to mine. By having the circles move randomly to
    different positions, it makes it seem as though the users are playing a game. In order to link the different 
    sounds, users will have to keep track of which circle plays which sound, as well as keep track of the circles 
    current position so they know where to move their mouse. For the feedback principal, its quite simply having 
    the circles play a different musical sound when being hovered over. I tried to find a wide range of musical 
    sounds from different instruments. The reason for this is so that users can have a bit more variety while 
    experimenting with the website. 

    The sounds used for the code are as follows: 
    chime.mp3 - https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/chime-sound-7143/
    a3.mp3 - https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/a3-101081/
    b5.mp3 - https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/03-b5-82301/
    clap.mp3 - https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/clap-2-95736/
    piano-g.mp3 - https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/piano-g-6200/
    punch.mp3 - https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/punch-boxing-02wav-14897/
    sd.mp3 - https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/sd-10-40943/
    snare.mp3 - https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/snare-112754/

    The chosen colour scheme consist of 8 different colours for the 8 different circles. I used a dark grey background 
    for the website allowing the circles to stand out. The colours of the circle are simply different colours of the 
    rainbow. This was done to contrast each circle from eachother, as well as to imply each circle is different from 
    every other circle. However it also implies that together the circles can form something greater, like how the 
    different colours form a rainbow. 

    Admittedly the sounds chosen may not be the best sounds to create a musical melody, but if given more time and 
    options, in order to improve my website I would like to focus more on choosing better sounds, or even hopefully 
    created the different musical sounds on my own.
