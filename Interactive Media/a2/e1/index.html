    <!-- Assignment 2 experiement 1 -->

    <!-- For the assignment, I have chosen the image of Akira page 167 volumn 1. This is becasue I have a huge fan 
    of the Japanese anime and manga culture. To start off with the wireframing I decided to use flexboxes rather than 
    grids in order to create my panels. I separated the container into 3 different rows, and then each row had their own 
    divisions in them to create the layout of the panels. As Akira is a very well known manga, I wanted to keep the 
    aesthetics similar to what a manga would look like. So for the colour palette I only picked 3 colours: White, grey and 
    black. In panels that seem to have a majority of grey I made the background grey, and in panels that seem to have the 
    majority of white I kept white. However I also wanted to highlight the textboxes from page 167 so I created circles in 
    the panel and coloured them in black. I kept the borders straight and solid. This is because when Akira was being created
    in the 1980's, manga panels were traditionaly black and either squares or rectangles. I didn't want my aesthetics to stray
    too far from the original copy as Akira is considered a staple piece in japanese anime and manga history. Overall it was 
    also the reason why I decided to keep the code simple. -->
