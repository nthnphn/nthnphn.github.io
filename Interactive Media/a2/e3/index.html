  PROVIDE MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK TO THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS:
  1) <button> with the id of load-link on the loading page (index.html) 
    - For the load-link button I gave it an active class when clicked on. This is because the text states
      "Click to load page" so this means users will expect what it states. That when the button is clicked
      it will load the next page. Hence the to further complement this idea I made it so that the background 
      of the button changes into a darker colour when clicked on to showcase that the use has completed the 
      action. I made the button background change into a darker variant of the page background in order to 
      stand out.

  2) <div> with the id of load-throbber on the loading page (index.html) 
    - For the load throbber I changed it to a repeating linear gradient. The linear gradient is then split 
      two halves, one half is transparent and the other half is the darker variant of the page background 
      colour. By implementing an animation that moves the background to the right, and making it repeat 
      infinitely, the load-throbber acts as if it is constantly working. This helps the users think that 
      the website is actually "loading" or "working" to change pages.

  3) <li> inside of the <ol> inside of the <nav> on the information page (hosono.html) 
    - I implemented the hover function for the navigation list. At first I made it so that when the user
      hovers over the navigation menu, the different options would bold to identify which link you will be 
      clicking on. However I didn't think this was enough as all the links throughout the page do the same 
      thing. So I further added an arrow to appear when the navigation link is being hovered on to further 
      showcase which link the user will be clicking on.

  4) <button> with the id of mode-button on the information page (hosono.html)
    - For the mode-button I added a hover function that causes the opposite mode colour to cover the button  
      from the left. This helps give the idea that page will change modes. As the button is replaced with the
      opposite colour the page will be as well. The button in light-mode will change to black when hovered over
      while the button in dark-mode will change to a cream coloured when hovered. This helps users get the 
      what the button is used for without having to need to read or understand "light mode" or "dark mode."

  5) switchModes() function - hint you can add a transition CSS property to the <body> and it will be inherited 
     by all the elements inside, so when custom CSS variables are changed it will apply transition
    - I gave the switchMode function a transition of 3 seconds cause I believe that is enough time for users to
      adjust to the switch of colours when the page is changed. It is not too quick or too long.

        Typically I'd use an <a> here but as we're faking a load time I'm using a <button> instead.  If it was an 
        <a> I would leave off the target attribute so that it would redirect the current tab.

        The function loadPageAfterDelay() is declared in the file fakeLoad.js - it takes a number value that sets the 
        amount of time it takes in ms and a url to redirect to.

        This is a div we're using for the throbber - if we wanted to do a % based loading bar there is an element 
        called <progress> but as this one is just indicating a wait rather than providing direct feedback on progress I've 
        opted for using a <div>.
